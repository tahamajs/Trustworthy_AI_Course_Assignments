# Descriptions of Data Sets

The following datasets are used in examples:

- Adult Dataset

- Student Performance Dataset

- German Credit Data

- CDC Diabetes Health Indicators

## Adult Dataset

Also known as the 'Census Income' data set. The goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year.

## Student Performance Dataset

This dataset includes student achievement in two Portuguese schools. It contains demographic, social, and academic features related to student performance in math and Portuguese language courses. The goal is typically to predict final grades, but it can also be used to explore fairness and educational outcomes across student groups.

## German Credit Data

This dataset contains information on individuals applying for credit in Germany. It includes both numerical and categorical features about credit history, personal information, and loan conditions. The goal is to classify applicants as good or bad credit risks, making it suitable for bias detection and fairness evaluation in financial decision-making.

## CDC Diabetes Health Indicators

This dataset contains health-related data from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). It includes responses from U.S. adults about health behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive service use. The primary use case is predicting the presence or risk of diabetes, with applications in fairness, public health analysis, and risk stratification.

## Heart Disease

This dataset originates from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and is commonly used for binary classification tasks to determine the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. It includes clinical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results. The goal is to predict the likelihood of heart disease, making the dataset useful for explainability, bias assessment, and health risk modeling.
