# HomeWorks Directory

This directory contains all course projects (`HW1` to `HW4`).

## Shared structure

Most homework folders follow this layout:

- `code`: runnable scripts, notebooks, and project-specific dependencies.
- `description`: assignment statement and supporting PDFs.
- `report`: LaTeX report template and bibliography.
- `README.md`: project-level overview and run guide.

## Project index

- `HW1`: image-model generalization and robustness experiments.
- `HW2`: interpretability for tabular and computer vision tasks.
- `HW3`: causal recourse with structural causal models.
- `HW4`: security/privacy/fairness implementations.

## Where methods are documented

- High-level methods: each `HW*/README.md`.
- Implementation details: each `HW*/code/README.md`.
- Assignment requirements: each `HW*/description/README.md`.
