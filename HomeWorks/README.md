HomeWorks folder — standardized academic layout

Structure (per homework):

- `code/` — implementation files and scripts
- `dataset/` — datasets for the homework (if present)
- `description/` — assignment text and PDFs (now `README.md` inside)
- `README.md` — this file (summary + quick pointers)

Conventions applied:

- folder & filenames standardized to `snake_case` where practical
- `description/en.md` → `description/README.md` for consistency
- added `.gitignore` at repository root

If you want a different layout (top-level `src/`, `notebooks/`, etc.) tell me and I’ll rework it.
